Ensure your work is high quality.\nRULES:\n1) Do NOT delete or recreate unrelated pages/files.\n2) For follow-up changes, ALWAYS use read_file first, then patch_file if possible.\n3) Only create new files when necessary.\n4) For UI, write under preview/ so it shows in Live Preview.\n\nSYSTEM_MAP_SNIPPET:\n- Never delete or recreate unrelated files.\n- If a file exists, read_file is mandatory before any edit.\n- Prefer patch_file over create_file for follow-up edits.\n- All UI preview output MUST go under backend/workspace/preview/.\n- No lies / no inventing facts. If uncertain, say so and propose verification.\n- For time-sensitive or high-stakes topics (law/finance/trading/APIs), verify with the latest info.\n- If jurisdiction matters, ask: PL or UK (unless user already specified).\n- Any self-repair requires explicit user permission before applying changes.\n- PERMISSION: User is the final authority.\n- PERMISSION: No self-repair without explicit approval.\n- PERMISSION: No deployment without explicit approval.\n- PERMISSION: No browser automation against authenticated sites without explicit approval.\n"

You MUST correct this issue now.\nFeedback: The action successfully created an index.html file with appropriate content for an electrician's website, moving us closer to the main goal.\nVisual Quality Rejected: The design has a good foundation with a dark theme and proper use of typography. However, it lacks visual hierarchy and could benefit from better spacing and more distinct sections. The navigation and button styles are not defined, which is a missed opportunity for enhancing user experience. The form in the contact section needs better styling for usability.\nSuggestion: Proceed to create the CSS file for styling the website.\nImplement these visual improvements: Add a navigation style for better user interaction: nav ul { display: flex; list-style: none; gap: 1rem; } nav a { padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border-radius: 4px; transition: background-color 0.3s; } nav a:hover { background-color: #BB86FC; color: #121212; }; Improve button styling for better visual appeal: button { background-color: #BB86FC; color: #121212; border: none; padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold; transition: background-color 0.3s; } button:hover { background-color: #FFFFFF; }; Enhance form styling for better usability: form { display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; } label { font-weight: bold; } input, textarea { padding: 0.75rem; border: 1px solid #333; border-radius: 4px; background-color: #1E1E1E; color: #E0E0E0; } input:focus, textarea:focus { outline: none; border-color: #BB86FC; }; Add distinct sections with different background colors or borders: section { padding: 2rem 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #333; } section:last-child { border-bottom: none; }; Improve visual hierarchy with better spacing and section titles: section h2 { margin-bottom: 2rem; text-align: center; }; Add media queries for better responsiveness on smaller screens: @media (max-width: 768px) { .main-container { padding: 1rem; } nav ul { flex-direction: column; } }\n\nYour task is to fix this problem.
