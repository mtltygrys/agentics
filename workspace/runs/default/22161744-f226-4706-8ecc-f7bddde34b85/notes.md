## Failures & Issues

- **Placeholder Images**: Used Unsplash placeholders which may not align with client's brand or services.
- **Performance Risks**: Potential performance issues due to unoptimized images.

## Wrong Assumptions

- Assumed placeholder images would be sufficient for initial implementation without client's input.

## Blockers

- Lack of specific images provided by the client.
- Unoptimized images may cause performance issues.

## Minimal Fixes

- Replace placeholder images with client-provided images.
- Optimize images for faster loading times.
